Most works I create are not on this website, those that are, are likely useless for anyone and just fun projects from myself.

Currently not active on this platform.
I work a lot on the Roblox platform.

You can find my Projects list <b><a href="https://github.com/users/spacecr4zygamer/projects/1">here</a></b>.

My knowledge:
- Lua, Luau
- Java
- Some HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/SQL
- Learning slowly C++
- Interest in learning Python, JS
- Will probably learn C soon

You can reach me on Discord (sp4cebase#5794) best.
